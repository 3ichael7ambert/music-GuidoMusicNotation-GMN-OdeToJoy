# Guido Music Notation

I love to make music and I love to program.
So how about we make music with programming languages?

```gun
% Guido Music Notation
% Title: Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
% Composer: Traditional

tempo 4=120

{ c e g e | d f a f | g2 g | e2 e | c e g e | d f a f | g2 g | e2 e }
```

This example shows a simple Guido Music Notation file.
